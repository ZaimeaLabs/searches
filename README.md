## Introduction

Searches is a powerful, expressive, and lightweight Laravel package designed to make advanced full-text–style searching effortless.
The package allows you to search across models, multiple columns, relationships, eager-loaded data, and even multiple models in a single query.

It supports relevance sorting, multi-word queries, conditional search rules, pagination, and more—making it perfect for building robust search features in modern Laravel applications.
